description: Use to drive a single GitHub issue to a pull request with the kagura-engineer harness — shells out to `kagura-engineer run <issue>` (guard → recall → worktree → start → implement → ship → persist). HARNESS — this mutates the repo, creates a PR, and spends model budget; confirm with the user before launching.

# kagura-engineer: run

Thin wrapper around the `kagura-engineer run` CLI verb. It drives one GitHub issue
through the full memory-grounded loop to an open PR. It reimplements nothing — the
orchestration lives entirely in the CLI; this skill discovers config, gates on
`doctor`, shells out, and surfaces the result.

> ⚠️ **This is a Harness, not an atomic tool.** Before launching, make sure the user
> understands the consequences and has confirmed:
> - **Repo mutation** — creates a `run-<issue>` git worktree and commits there.
> - **PR creation** — opens a GitHub pull request via gh-issue-driven on success.
> - **Cost** — invokes `claude -p` multiple times (start / implement / ship).
> - **HITL** — gates can halt (`blocked`, exit 2) and wait for a human decision.

**Announce:** "Using the kagura-engineer:run skill — this is a Harness that will create a PR."

## Steps

1. **Validate the issue argument.** The CLI takes a single positive integer issue
   number. Reject anything that does not match `^[1-9][0-9]{0,8}$` before interpolating
   it into the shell — do not pass free-form text through.

2. **Discover config.** `repo.yaml` in CWD by default; pass `--config <path>` otherwise.

3. **Precondition — run doctor:**

   ```bash
   kagura-engineer doctor --json
   ```

   If `overall == "fail"` (exit 1), **stop**: surface the blocking checks and hand off
   to `kagura-engineer:setup`. Do not proceed to run. (`ok`/`warn` may proceed.)

4. **Confirm with the user** (the Harness warning above) unless they have already
   opted into an unattended run.

5. **Run:**

   ```bash
   kagura-engineer run <issue> --json
   ```

   Add `--unattended` to suppress interactive gates, `--no-remember` to skip the memory
   savepoint. Without `--json`, phase progress streams live.

6. **Interpret the status.** `status == "ok"` (exit 0) → PR created (`pr_url`).
   `"blocked"` (exit 2) → a gate halted; show `resume_hint` and surface the verdict for
   a human decision. `"fail"` (exit 1) → hard error; show the failing phase's `detail`
   from the `phases` array (there is no top-level `detail` key).

7. **Surface & hand off.** Print the phase table and `pr_url`. On success, suggest
   `kagura-engineer:review <pr_url>` to review the PR. On `blocked`/`fail`, surface the
   `resume_hint` so the user can retry after addressing the cause.
