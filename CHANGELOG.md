## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-08

### Added

- **Claude Code skill-plugin wrapper** (`.claude-plugin/` + `skills/`) — `kagura-engineer`
  is now installable and discoverable as a plugin. Five thin skills
  (`kagura-engineer:doctor` / `:setup` / `:run` / `:review` / `:goal`) shell out to the
  CLI; referenceable by the `kagura-plugins` marketplace as a Tier-2 Harness. (#28, #30)
- **Failover memory** — Cloud-primary write durability backed by a local WAL, so a
  transient Memory Cloud outage no longer drops savepoints. (#27)
- **Incremental phase progress** streamed to stdout during `run` (suppressed under
  `--json`). (#12)
- `doctor` / `setup` now guide the Memory Cloud credential, with the README reconciled. (#6)

### Changed

- Aligned the feedback-weight contract across the cloud and local memory backends. (#21)
- Dropped the stale README "Status" table and added a "Releasing" note documenting the
  version single-source-of-truth (`__init__.py`, mirrored by the plugin manifests). (#31)
- `repo.yaml` is gitignored as per-checkout config. (#7)

### Fixed

- Added a dedicated `implement` phase between `start` and `ship`. (#9)
- Bridged the async kagura-memory SDK from the sync `MemoryClient`, and close the client
  so cloud `run`/`goal` exit cleanly. (#1, #14)
- A green `ship` that produced no PR URL now fails instead of reporting success. (#18)
- Made the native `## Verdict:` fallback phase-aware, used when the `KAGURA_VERDICT=`
  marker is absent. (#3)
- Mapped cloud feedback weight to `helpful` so reinforcement works. (#16)
- Surfaced headless `claude` stdout on failure with an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` hint, tightened
  the auth-failure regex, and documented `--json` progress suppression. (#19)

### Internal

- Added a skill↔CLI verb-drift guard test so a new/renamed CLI verb without a matching
  skill fails CI. (#31)

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-08

First public release. `kagura-engineer` is a `0.x` autonomous coding harness over
[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) and Kagura Memory — not a finished actor.

### Added

- `doctor` — diagnose the dependency chain (git, claude, gh, ollama, Memory Cloud)
  with a backend-aware memory check.
- `setup` — install missing dependencies via the platform package manager and
  bootstrap auth; idempotent and re-runnable.
- `run` — memory-grounded agent loop driving an issue toward a PR, with
  cheap-resume savepoints and grounding enriched by recall + explore neighbours.
- `review` — launch the separate `kagura-code-reviewer` console script, read its
  JSON envelope, and gate on the verdict (`red`→halt, `green`/`yellow`→proceed).
  Available as the optional `review` extra (`pip install "kagura-engineer[review]"`);
  degrades to a clean FAIL gate when the reviewer is absent.
- `review --fix` — auto review/fix loop (Plan 4b).
- `goal <milestone>` — drive a whole milestone, with an optional `--unattended` flag.
- `LocalMemoryClient` — offline SQLite memory backend (no API key required),
  with local pinning (pin/unpin), recall tag/importance filters, graph `explore`,
  and decay maintenance clamped to `[0, 1]`.
- `memory_mcp_config` — additively attach the memory MCP server to the headless
  `claude` subprocess.
- `--version` flag on the top-level CLI.
- `memory_backend: local` no longer requires the Memory Cloud fields
  (`memory_cloud_url`/`workspace_id`/`context_id`); an offline `repo.yaml` is
  just `profile` + `memory_backend: local`. They stay required for the (default)
  cloud backend.
